# Snakes and Ladders Game

Snakes and Ladders is a fun and simple game of chance that is enjoyed by people of all ages. The game is played on a board with 100 numbered squares. Each square has a ladder or a snake on it. Players take turns rolling a die and moving their piece along the board. If they land on a square with a ladder, they climb up the ladder to the next square. If they land on a square with a snake, they slide down the snake to the next square. The first player to reach the 100th square wins the game.

This is a simple yet engaging Snakes and Ladders game created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The game features a colorful and interactive board, simple animation and a clear user interface. Players can choose to roll a dice or two, navigate the board, and experience the thrill of climbing ladders or sliding down snakes.

## How to play
